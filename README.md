## Dependency Injection in spring 

### ✅ What is Dependency Injection in Spring?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Spring to loose couple the classes by injecting dependent objects at runtime rather than creating them manually inside the class.

### 🔧 Why use Dependency Injection?

Promotes loose coupling.

Improves testability and maintainability.

Makes the code more flexible and scalable

### 💡 Types of Dependency Injection in Spring:

### ✅ **1. What is the difference between constructor and setter injection?**

**Answer:**

> In Spring, **constructor injection** injects dependencies through a class constructor, whereas **setter injection** uses public setter methods to inject dependencies after the object is constructed.
> 
> Constructor injection is preferred when the dependency is **mandatory**, while setter injection is suitable for **optional** dependencies.

----------

### ✅ **2. Which injection type is preferred and why?**

**Answer:**

> **Constructor injection** is generally preferred in Spring because:
> 
> -   It ensures that the object is always created with all its required dependencies.
>     
> -   It supports **immutability** and promotes **testability**.
>     
> -   It makes the code more **robust** by avoiding the risk of partially initialized beans.
>     

----------

### ✅ **3. Can you inject a bean into another bean?**

**Answer:**

> Yes, Spring allows injecting one bean into another using **Dependency Injection**. This is commonly done using annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, or via constructor/setter injection.
> 
> For example, if `StudentService` needs `StudentRepository`, Spring will automatically inject it if both are marked as Spring beans.

----------

### ✅ **4. What happens if multiple beans of the same type exist?**

**Answer:**

> If multiple beans of the same type exist in the Spring context, Spring will throw a **NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException** during injection.
> 
> To resolve this, we can:
> 
> -   Use `@Qualifier("beanName")` to specify which bean to inject.
>     
> -   Use `@Primary` to mark one bean as the default.
>     

----------

### ✅ **5. How does Spring know which dependency to inject?**

**Answer:**

> Spring uses **type-based autowiring** by default. It scans the application context and injects the dependency based on the **type**.
> 
> If multiple beans of the same type are available, Spring uses:
> 
> -   `@Qualifier` for explicit bean selection.
>     
> -   `@Primary` for default bean selection.
>     
> 
> Also, Spring supports **constructor-based autowiring** where parameter names and types help it resolve the correct dependency.


### ✅ **1. What are HTTP status codes?**

**Answer:**

> HTTP status codes are **3-digit codes** returned by the server in response to a client's request. They indicate whether the request was successful, failed, or needs further action. These codes are grouped into different categories based on their first digit.

----------

### ✅ **2. Can you name and explain the different categories of HTTP status codes?**

**Answer:**

Category

Range

Meaning

1xx

100–199

Informational – Request received, continuing process.

2xx

200–299

Success – Request was successful.

3xx

300–399

Redirection – Further action needed.

4xx

400–499

Client Error – Request had issues.

5xx

500–599

Server Error – Server failed to fulfill request.

----------

### ✅ **3. What are the most commonly used HTTP status codes in REST APIs?**

**Answer:**

-   `200 OK`: Request was successful.
    
-   `201 Created`: Resource was successfully created.
    
-   `204 No Content`: Request was successful, no data returned.
    
-   `400 Bad Request`: Client sent an invalid request.
    
-   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required or failed.
    
-   `403 Forbidden`: Client does not have access rights.
    
-   `404 Not Found`: Requested resource does not exist.
    
-   `409 Conflict`: Conflict occurred (e.g., duplicate data).
    
-   `500 Internal Server Error`: Server encountered an error.
    
-   `503 Service Unavailable`: Server is down or overloaded.
    

----------

### ✅ **4. What’s the difference between 401 and 403 status codes?**

**Answer:**

> `401 Unauthorized` means the user is not authenticated (missing or invalid credentials).  
> `403 Forbidden` means the user is authenticated but **not authorized** to access the resource.

----------

### ✅ **5. When should you return 204 No Content?**

**Answer:**

> `204 No Content` should be returned when a request is successful, but there's **no need to return any data**. For example, after a successful DELETE operation.

----------

### ✅ **6. What status code should be returned for validation errors?**

**Answer:**

> Usually, **`400 Bad Request`** is used for validation errors.  
> If you want to provide more details, you can return a **custom error body** with field-specific messages

# Transaction 

## ✅ **1. What is a transaction in Spring?**

**Answer:**

> A **transaction** in Spring is a **sequence of operations** performed as a single unit of work. It ensures that either **all operations succeed** or **none are applied**, maintaining **data integrity** and **consistency**.

----------

## ✅ **2. What are the key properties of a transaction (ACID)?**

Property

Description

**A - Atomicity**

All operations in a transaction are completed; if one fails, all are rolled back.

**C - Consistency**

The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.

**I - Isolation**

Transactions are isolated from each other; intermediate states are not visible.

**D - Durability**

Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent.

----------

## ✅ **3. How does Spring manage transactions?**

**Answer:**

> Spring provides **declarative transaction management** using the `@Transactional` annotation.
> 
> It uses **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** to create proxies around methods and handles commit or rollback based on exceptions.

----------

## ✅ **4. What is `@Transactional` and how is it used?**

**Answer:**

> `@Transactional` is a Spring annotation used to mark methods or classes where **transactional behavior** is required.  
> When applied, Spring starts a transaction before the method runs and **commits** it if it completes successfully, or **rolls back** if an exception is thrown.

java

CopyEdit

`@Service  public  class  PaymentService { @Transactional  public  void  transferMoney(...) { // DB operations }
}` 

----------

## ✅ **5. What are propagation and isolation in Spring transactions?**

**Answer:**

> -   **Propagation** defines how transactions behave when called from another transactional method. Common types:
>     
>     -   `REQUIRED` (default): Join existing or create new transaction.
>         
>     -   `REQUIRES_NEW`: Always creates a new transaction.
>         
>     -   `NESTED`: Executes within a nested transaction.
>         

> -   **Isolation** defines how data accessed by one transaction is **isolated** from others. Common levels:
>     
>     -   `READ_COMMITTED`, `READ_UNCOMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE_READ`, `SERIALIZABLE`.
>         

----------

## ✅ **6. When does Spring roll back a transaction by default?**

**Answer:**

> By default, Spring only rolls back a transaction when an **unchecked exception** (`RuntimeException` or `Error`) is thrown.
> 
> To roll back on **checked exceptions**, you need to configure `@Transactional` like:


`@Transactional(rollbackFor = SomeCheckedException.class)` 

----------

## ✅ **7. Can we use `@Transactional` on private methods?**

**Answer:**

> No, `@Transactional` does **not work on private methods** because Spring uses **proxies**, and private methods cannot be intercepted

# Microservices

## ✅ **1. What are Microservices?**

**Answer:**

> Microservices is an architectural style where an application is **broken into small, independent services**, each responsible for a specific business function.  
> These services **communicate via APIs (usually REST or messaging systems like Kafka)** and are **independently deployable and scalable**.

----------

## ✅ **2. What are the main benefits of Microservices?**

**Answer:**

-   **Scalability** – Scale individual components independently.
    
-   **Flexibility in Tech Stack** – Each service can use a different language/tech.
    
-   **Independent Deployment** – Less risk while deploying changes.
    
-   **Resilience** – One service failure doesn't crash the entire app.
    
-   **Faster Development** – Small teams can work in parallel on different services.
    

----------

## ✅ **3. What are some challenges in Microservices?**

**Answer:**

-   **Distributed system complexity**
    
-   **Data consistency**
    
-   **Service discovery and communication**
    
-   **Centralized logging and monitoring**
    
-   **Security across services**
    

----------

## ✅ **4. How do Microservices communicate with each other?**

**Answer:**

> Services can communicate using:

-   **Synchronous** protocols like **REST (HTTP)** or **gRPC**.
    
-   **Asynchronous** protocols using **messaging queues** (e.g., **Kafka**, **RabbitMQ**).
    

----------

## ✅ **5. What is Service Discovery?**

**Answer:**

> In microservices, services are dynamic (scale up/down), so **Service Discovery** allows services to register themselves and discover each other.  
> Tools: **Eureka (Netflix OSS)**, **Consul**, **Zookeeper**.

----------

## ✅ **6. How do you handle API Gateway in Microservices?**

**Answer:**

> API Gateway is a single entry point for clients to interact with multiple services.  
> It handles:

-   Request routing
    
-   Authentication & authorization
    
-   Rate limiting
    
-   Logging and monitoring
    

📌 Example: **Spring Cloud Gateway**, **Kong**, **Zuul**

----------

## ✅ **7. How do you manage configuration in Microservices?**

**Answer:**

> Use a **centralized configuration server**, like **Spring Cloud Config**, to manage configs across services.  
> This avoids hardcoding values and enables dynamic updates.

----------

## ✅ **8. How do you ensure fault tolerance in Microservices?**

**Answer:**

> Tools and techniques:

-   **Circuit Breaker** (e.g., Resilience4j, Hystrix)
    
-   **Retry and Timeout**
    
-   **Fallback methods**
    
-   **Bulkheads and Rate Limiting**
    

----------

## ✅ **9. How is data handled in Microservices?**

**Answer:**

> Each microservice has its **own database** (Database per service pattern) to ensure loose coupling and data ownership.  
> Data consistency is handled via **eventual consistency**, not transactions.

----------

## ✅ **10. How do you monitor Microservices?**

**Answer:**

> Use Observability tools like:

-   **Micrometer** for metrics
    
-   **Prometheus + Grafana** for monitoring
    
-   **ELK Stack / Splunk** for logs

- **Zipkin / Jaeger** for distributed tracing

```
`(int a, int b) -> a + b` 
```
----------

### 🔹 **3. What is a Functional Interface?**

**Answer:**

> An interface with exactly **one abstract method** is called a functional interface.

-   `Function<T, R>`
    
-   `Predicate<T>`
    
```
`@FunctionalInterface  public  interface  MyInterface { void  test();
}
```
----------

### 🔹 **4. What is the Stream API?**

**Answer:**

> Stream API is used to **process collections in a functional and declarative way**, using operations like `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, `collect`, etc.
```
`List<String> names = list.stream()
                         .filter(s -> s.startsWith("A"))
                         .collect(Collectors.toList());` 
```
----------

### 🔹 **5. Difference between map() and flatMap()?**

**Answer:**

Feature

`map()`

`flatMap()`

Output

Stream of elements

Flattened Stream

Use case

Transform each element

Flatten nested structure
```

`list.stream().map(String::toUpperCase)
list.stream().flatMap(List::stream)` 
```
----------

### 🔹 **6. What are Intermediate and Terminal operations in Streams?**

**Answer:**

-   **Intermediate**: Returns another stream → `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`
    
-   **Terminal**: Produces result → `collect()`, `count()`, `forEach()`
    

----------

### 🔹 **7. What are Collectors? Give examples.**

**Answer:** `Collectors` is a utility class used with streams for reducing data.

Examples:

-   `toList()`
    
-   `toSet()`

-   `partitioningBy()`
    
-   `joining()`
    
-   `summarizingInt()`
    
-   `counting()`
    
```

list.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(String::length))` 
```
----------

### 🔹 **8. What is Optional in Java 8?**

**Answer:** `Optional<T>` is a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value.  
It helps **avoid null checks and NullPointerExceptions**.




`Optional<String> name = Optional.of("Subba");
name.ifPresent(System.out::println);` 

----------

### 🔹 **9. Difference between orElse(), orElseGet(), and orElseThrow()?**

**Answer:**

-   `orElse(value)` → always evaluates the value
    
-   `orElseGet(Supplier)` → evaluates only when Optional is empty
    
-   `orElseThrow()` → throws exception if value is missing
    

----------

### 🔹 **10. What are Default and Static Methods in Interfaces?**

**Answer:**

> Java 8 allows us to add methods with **implementation** in interfaces using `default` or `static`.


`default  void  log() {
    System.out.println("logging...");
} static  void  print() {
    System.out.println("printing...");
}` 

----------

### 🔹 **11. Can two interfaces have the same default method?**

**Answer:**

> Yes, but if a class implements both, it must override the method to resolve the conflict.

----------

### 🔹 **12. What are Method References?**

**Answer:**

> A shorter syntax for calling existing methods using `::`.


`list.forEach(System.out::println); // Static list.stream().map(String::toUpperCase); // Instance method` 

----------

### 🔹 **13. What is the new Date and Time API in Java 8?**

## **What is the difference between Stack and Heap Memory Area in Java**

In Java, Stack and Heap are two important memory areas used for different purposes during the execution of a program. Here's a clear and concise comparison between the two:

## Dependency Injection in spring 

### âœ… What is Dependency Injection in Spring?

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Spring to loose couple the classes by injecting dependent objects at runtime rather than creating them manually inside the class.

### ðŸ”§ Why use Dependency Injection?

Promotes loose coupling.

Improves testability and maintainability.

Makes the code more flexible and scalable

### ðŸ’¡ Types of Dependency Injection in Spring:

### âœ… **1. What is the difference between constructor and setter injection?**

**Answer:**

> In Spring, **constructor injection** injects dependencies through a class constructor, whereas **setter injection** uses public setter methods to inject dependencies after the object is constructed.
> 
> Constructor injection is preferred when the dependency is **mandatory**, while setter injection is suitable for **optional** dependencies.

----------

### âœ… **2. Which injection type is preferred and why?**

**Answer:**

> **Constructor injection** is generally preferred in Spring because:
> 
> -   It ensures that the object is always created with all its required dependencies.
>     
> -   It supports **immutability** and promotes **testability**.
>     
> -   It makes the code more **robust** by avoiding the risk of partially initialized beans.
>     

----------

### âœ… **3. Can you inject a bean into another bean?**

**Answer:**

> Yes, Spring allows injecting one bean into another using **Dependency Injection**. This is commonly done using annotations like `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, or via constructor/setter injection.
> 
> For example, if `StudentService` needs `StudentRepository`, Spring will automatically inject it if both are marked as Spring beans.

----------

### âœ… **4. What happens if multiple beans of the same type exist?**

**Answer:**

> If multiple beans of the same type exist in the Spring context, Spring will throw a **NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException** during injection.
> 
> To resolve this, we can:
> 
> -   Use `@Qualifier("beanName")` to specify which bean to inject.
>     
> -   Use `@Primary` to mark one bean as the default.
>     

----------

### âœ… **5. How does Spring know which dependency to inject?**

**Answer:**

> Spring uses **type-based autowiring** by default. It scans the application context and injects the dependency based on the **type**.
> 
> If multiple beans of the same type are available, Spring uses:
> 
> -   `@Qualifier` for explicit bean selection.
>     
> -   `@Primary` for default bean selection.
>     
> 
> Also, Spring supports **constructor-based autowiring** where parameter names and types help it resolve the correct dependency.


### âœ… **1. What are HTTP status codes?**

**Answer:**

> HTTP status codes are **3-digit codes** returned by the server in response to a client's request. They indicate whether the request was successful, failed, or needs further action. These codes are grouped into different categories based on their first digit.

----------

### âœ… **2. Can you name and explain the different categories of HTTP status codes?**

**Answer:**

Category

Range

Meaning

1xx

100â€“199

Informational â€“ Request received, continuing process.

2xx

200â€“299

Success â€“ Request was successful.

3xx

300â€“399

Redirection â€“ Further action needed.

4xx

400â€“499

Client Error â€“ Request had issues.

5xx

500â€“599

Server Error â€“ Server failed to fulfill request.

----------

### âœ… **3. What are the most commonly used HTTP status codes in REST APIs?**

**Answer:**

-   `200 OK`: Request was successful.
    
-   `201 Created`: Resource was successfully created.
    
-   `204 No Content`: Request was successful, no data returned.
    
-   `400 Bad Request`: Client sent an invalid request.
    
-   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required or failed.
    
-   `403 Forbidden`: Client does not have access rights.
    
-   `404 Not Found`: Requested resource does not exist.
    
-   `409 Conflict`: Conflict occurred (e.g., duplicate data).
    
-   `500 Internal Server Error`: Server encountered an error.
    
-   `503 Service Unavailable`: Server is down or overloaded.
    

----------

### âœ… **4. Whatâ€™s the difference between 401 and 403 status codes?**

**Answer:**

> `401 Unauthorized` means the user is not authenticated (missing or invalid credentials).  
> `403 Forbidden` means the user is authenticated but **not authorized** to access the resource.

----------

### âœ… **5. When should you return 204 No Content?**

**Answer:**

> `204 No Content` should be returned when a request is successful, but there's **no need to return any data**. For example, after a successful DELETE operation.

----------

### âœ… **6. What status code should be returned for validation errors?**

**Answer:**

> Usually, **`400 Bad Request`** is used for validation errors.  
> If you want to provide more details, you can return a **custom error body** with field-specific messages

# Transaction 

## âœ… **1. What is a transaction in Spring?**

**Answer:**

> A **transaction** in Spring is a **sequence of operations** performed as a single unit of work. It ensures that either **all operations succeed** or **none are applied**, maintaining **data integrity** and **consistency**.

----------

## âœ… **2. What are the key properties of a transaction (ACID)?**

Property

Description

**A - Atomicity**

All operations in a transaction are completed; if one fails, all are rolled back.

**C - Consistency**

The database remains in a consistent state before and after the transaction.

**I - Isolation**

Transactions are isolated from each other; intermediate states are not visible.

**D - Durability**

Once a transaction is committed, the changes are permanent.

----------

## âœ… **3. How does Spring manage transactions?**

**Answer:**

> Spring provides **declarative transaction management** using the `@Transactional` annotation.
> 
> It uses **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** to create proxies around methods and handles commit or rollback based on exceptions.

----------

## âœ… **4. What is `@Transactional` and how is it used?**

**Answer:**

> `@Transactional` is a Spring annotation used to mark methods or classes where **transactional behavior** is required.  
> When applied, Spring starts a transaction before the method runs and **commits** it if it completes successfully, or **rolls back** if an exception is thrown.

CopyEdit

`@Service  public  class  PaymentService { @Transactional  public  void  transferMoney(...) { // DB operations }
}` 

----------

## âœ… **5. What are propagation and isolation in Spring transactions?**

**Answer:**

> -   **Propagation** defines how transactions behave when called from another transactional method. Common types:
>     
>     -   `REQUIRED` (default): Join existing or create new transaction.
>         
>     -   `REQUIRES_NEW`: Always creates a new transaction.
>         
>     -   `NESTED`: Executes within a nested transaction.
>         

> -   **Isolation** defines how data accessed by one transaction is **isolated** from others. Common levels:
>     
>     -   `READ_COMMITTED`, `READ_UNCOMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE_READ`, `SERIALIZABLE`.
>         

----------

## âœ… **6. When does Spring roll back a transaction by default?**

**Answer:**

> By default, Spring only rolls back a transaction when an **unchecked exception** (`RuntimeException` or `Error`) is thrown.
> 
> To roll back on **checked exceptions**, you need to configure `@Transactional` like:


`@Transactional(rollbackFor = SomeCheckedException.class)` 

----------

## âœ… **7. Can we use `@Transactional` on private methods?**

**Answer:**

> No, `@Transactional` does **not work on private methods** because Spring uses **proxies**, and private methods cannot be intercepted
